## Homework Q13 and Q14

Section 4 is on *Population Scale Analysis*. 

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3 expression. 

Download file from class website. First column will be sample name, second is genotype and third are the expression values.


How many samples do we have?

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
>Q13. Determine sample size for each genotype and corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

>Q14. Generate boxplot.  What could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3? 

Let's make a boxplot

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch= TRUE)
```
A/A has a average higher expression value than G/G. YES.
